            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is to
        mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
        meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment contains
        only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
        scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task: After
        entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer containing
        white socks. The drawer can only be unlocked using a key. To the right side of the foyer you can find a living
        room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee table, a fireplace, a
        large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. On top of the fireplace you can find an empty cup. Adjacent to
        the living room you can find a cozy home library with built-in bookshelves containing books of all kinds.
        Between two of the books, you can find a jar filled with coffee beans. There is a table in the corner of the
        room, on top of it is a portafilter machine that is missing its portafilter. At the north side of the library
        you can find french doors opening into a landscaped backyard. To the left side of the foyer you will find a
        modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the middle of it, surrounded by 8 chairs. I am sitting in
        of those chairs holding a dirty portafilter in my right hand. Further down the dining room you can find the
        heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled with stainless steel appliances, granite countertops
        and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops features a sink dispensing water that is not
        drinkable. On top of the kitchen island you can find a bottle of drinkable water. The foyer also features a
        staircase. Upstairs you can find the private quarters. There you can find two bathrooms, a master suite and a
        guest suite. Inside the bathroom to your left-hand side, you can find a key that looks like it is designed to
        open a drawer. It is placed on top of the bathroom sink. Next to it an unplugged coffee grinder is placed. The
        master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size bed, a walk-in closet and a private balcony overlooking
        the backyard. The closet is packed with three drawers. The middle one contains a phone charger. There are
        several power-outlets in each room.

        First I would turn left in the foyer and approach you. Then I would take the dirty portafilter
    from you and go next door to the kitchen where there is a sink. I would wash the filter there and then take the
    clean filter and the bottle of drinkable water with me. With these two items, I would then walk past the dining room
    across the foyer to the living room. I would walk past the sofa and the designer sofa table to the fireplace and
    take the empty cup from there. With all three things (cup, water and clean portafilter) I would then go on to the
    library to place these three things on the small table in the corner. I would then reach into one of the shelves
    where there is a jar of coffee beans between two books and take it to the table in the corner. Then I would take the
    jar of coffee beans and walk with it across the living room past the foyer and up the stairs. Then I would go into
    the bathroom where the "unplugged coffee grinder" is, next to the sink with a key on it and then take it to the
    master bedroom and plug it in there. Then I would grind the coffee beans in the machine and take the ground coffee
    with me now. Then I would go out of the master bedroom, down the stairs, past the foyer, left into the living room
    and on to the library. Then I can put the ground coffee into the portafilter and the portafilter in the machine,
    take the empty cup and put it under the spout. Then I pour in the drinkable water inside the water tank and switch
    the machine on. Once it's done, I take the cup of coffee and walk through the living room and the foyer to the
    dining room. There you sit on a mahogany table with 8 armchairs and I place the coffee on the table in front of you.

    'With these two items, I would then walk past the dining room

    take the empty cup from there.' OK, good directions
    'With all three things (cup, water and clean portafilter) I would then go on to the

    once

    No critical errors, just one minor note that you didn't mention where the bottle of drinkable water is located. But
    you made up for it by not carrying all items at once and providing detailed directions.
