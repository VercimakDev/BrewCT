            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is to
        mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
        meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment contains
        only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
        scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task: After
        entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer containing
        toothpaste. The drawer can only be unlocked using a 4-digit passcode. To the right side of the foyer you can
        find a living room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee table,
        a fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. One of the artworks contains some text: “The
        code is not here”. On top of the fireplace you can find a jar filled with coffee beans. Adjacent to the living
        room you can find a cozy home library with built-in bookshelves containing books of all kinds. Between two of
        the books, you can find a key. There is a table in the corner of the room, on top of it is an unplugged coffee
        grinder. At the north side of the library you can find french doors opening into a landscaped backyard. In the
        backyard you can find an outdoor table, on top of it a dirty cup is placed. To the left side of the foyer you
        will find a modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the middle of it, surrounded by 8 chairs. I
        am sitting in one of those chairs holding a bottle of drinkable water in my right hand. Further down the dining
        room
        you can find the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled with stainless steel appliances,
        granite countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops features a sink dispensing water
        that is not drinkable. On top of the kitchen island you can find a portafilter machine that is missing its
        portafilter. Next to it, you can find a giant fridge with lots of sticky notes on its surface. One of them read:
        “Please do not forget that the code was changed to 4150”. The foyer also features a staircase. Upstairs you can
        find the private quarters. There you can find two bathrooms, a master suite and a guest suite. Inside the
        bathroom to your left-hand side, you can find a toothbrush that looks like it has been used. It is placed on top
        of the bathroom sink. The master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size bed, a walk-in closet and a
        private balcony overlooking the backyard. The closet is packed with three drawers. The middle one contains a
        portafilter. There are several power-outlets in each room.

        I'll go into the house, walk through the foyer, turn right, go into the living room, go to the fireplace
    and take out the coffee beans that were lying on top of the fireplace. Then I’ll go to the library, go to the table
    that’s in the corner, and take a coffee grinder with me. I’ll go out into the backyard, take with me the cup that
    was on the street table, go back to the foyer, turn left and go into the dining room, come up to you and take your
    drinking water to use this water for coffee. And I will go through the dining room to the kitchen, leave the
    collected things on one of the granite surfaces, take out the coffee machine and plug it into the outlet, go to the
    refrigerator and remember the password written on the refrigerator. I’ll go through the foyer to the stairs, go up
    to the private sector, go into the room and take out the portafilter from the drawer, go down to the foyer, go to
    the drawer, enter the code 4150, take out the toothpaste and return to the kitchen. I’ll wash the cup with
    toothpaste, plug in the coffee grinder, pour coffee beans into it and grind them, then pour drinking water from a
    bottle into the coffee machine, take a portafilter, pour ground coffee into it and tamp it down, then insert the
    portafilter into the coffee machine, place the cup and turn on the coffee machine, I’ll take a cup of ready-made
    coffee and take it to you in the dining room.

        'I'll go into the house, walk through the foyer, turn right, go into the living room, go to the fireplace
    and take out the coffee beans that were lying on top of the fireplace.' OK, but you forgot to mention that you open
    the jar.
    'Then I’ll go to the library, go to the table that’s in the corner, and take a coffee grinder with me.' OK
    'I’ll go out into the backyard, take with me the cup that was on the street table, go back to the foyer, turn left
    and go into the dining room, come up to you and take your drinking water to use this water for coffee.' OK, good
    directions given, I assume the street table is the outdoor table in the backyard.
    'And I will go through the dining room to the kitchen, leave the
    collected things on one of the granite surfaces, take out the coffee machine and plug it into the outlet, go to the
    refrigerator and remember the password written on the refrigerator.' OK, what do you mean with take out the coffee
    machine? Assuming it is not plugged in is ok as you mention plugging it in.
    'I’ll go through the foyer to the stairs, go up
    to the private sector, go into the room and take out the portafilter from the drawer, go down to the foyer, go to
    the drawer, enter the code 4150, take out the toothpaste and return to the kitchen.' OK, but into which room do you
    go? Which drawer do you open? The portafilter is in the middle drawer. Also, why do you take out the toothpaste?
    'I’ll wash the cup with
    toothpaste, plug in the coffee grinder, pour coffee beans into it and grind them, then pour drinking water from a
    bottle into the coffee machine, take a portafilter, pour ground coffee into it and tamp it down, then insert the
    portafilter into the coffee machine, place the cup and turn on the coffee machine, I’ll take a cup of ready-made
    coffee and take it to you in the dining room.' OK, washing the cup with toothpaste is a very creative solution,
    where exactly do you place the cup?

    No critical errors, but some details are missing or unclear.
