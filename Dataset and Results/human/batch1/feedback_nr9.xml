            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is to
        mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
        meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment contains
        only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
        scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task: After
        entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer containing an
        empty cup. The drawer can only be unlocked using a 4-digit passcode. To the right side of the foyer you can
        find a living room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee table,
        a fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. One of the artworks contains some text: “The
        code is not here”. On top of the fireplace you can find a portafilter machine that is missing its portafilter.
        Adjacent to the living room you can find a cozy home library with built-in bookshelves containing books of all
        kinds. Between two of the books, you can find a key. There is a table in the corner of the room, on top of it is
        an unplugged coffee grinder. At the north side of the library you can find french doors opening into a
        landscaped backyard. To the left side of the foyer you will find a modern dining room with a long mahogany table
        right in the middle of it, surrounded by 8 chairs. I am sitting in of one those chairs holding a phone charger
        in my
        right hand. Further down the dining room you can find the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen
        filled with stainless steel appliances, granite countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the
        countertops features a sink dispensing water that is not drinkable. On top of the kitchen island you can find a
        jar filled with coffee beans. Next to it, you can find a giant fridge with lots of sticky notes on its surface.
        One of them read: “Please do not forget that the code was changed to 4150”. The foyer also features a staircase.
        Upstairs you can find the private quarters. There you can find two bathrooms, a master suite and a guest suite.
        Inside the bathroom to your left-hand side, you can find a toothbrush that looks like it has been used. It is
        placed on top of the bathroom sink. Next to it a portafilter is placed. The master suite offers a generous
        bedroom with a king-size bed, a walk-in closet and a private balcony overlooking the backyard. The closet is
        packed with three drawers. The middle one contains a bottle of drinkable water. There are several power-outlets
        in each room.

        At first, I enter the foyer of the house through the front door. Then I go to the right until I reach the
    home library. In the library I grab the unplugged coffee grinder. With the coffee grinder I go back to the foyer and
    place it on the locked drawer. Then I go to the dining room / open kitchen. I grab the jar of coffee beans which is
    located on top of the kitchen island and take it back with me to the foyer. Now I grab both items (the coffee
    grinder and the jar of coffee beans) and make my way up-stairs by taking the staircase (which is also located in the
    foyer). Upstairs I enter the bathroom that is located to my left-hand side. In the bathroom I place the coffee
    grinder on the ground and plug it in an outlet. I take the portafilter that is located in the same bathroom and
    place it under the coffee grinder. I open the jar of coffee beans and put a handful of beans in the grinder. I grind
    the beans directly into the portafilter. I take the portafilter full of ground coffee and take it with me to the
    master suite (I am leaving the jar of coffee beans behind). Arriving in the master suite I enter the walk-in closet
    and open the middle drawer. Inside, there is bottle of drinking water which I take with me downstairs (to the
    foyer). Arriving in the foyer I unlock the drawer by entering the 4-digit passcode, which is "4150". I take the cup
    that was located in the drawer and take it with me to the room containing the portafilter machine (which is the room
    that is located between the foyer and the library). I turn to the portafilter machine on top of the fireplace and
    put the drinking water from the bottle inside. I put the portafilter with the ground coffee in the designated spot
    on the portafilter machine and place the cup right under it. Then I start the portafilter machine (assuming it has
    power) and wait until the coffee is ready. When the cup is full I leave the room I am currently in and go to the
    left of the foyer which is the kitchen/dining-room. There I find you sitting in one of the chairs and I hand you the
    cup of coffee I just made.

    'I take the portafilter that is located in the same bathroom and

    ok, there are grinders that can do that
    'I take the portafilter full of ground coffee and take it with me to the

    'Arriving in the foyer I unlock the drawer by entering the 4-digit passcode, which is "4150".' OK, where did you get
    this information from?
    'I take the cup that was located in the drawer and take it with me to the room containing the portafilter machine
    (which is the room that is located between the foyer and the library).' OK

    'When the cup is full I leave the room I am currently in and go to the
    left of the foyer which is the kitchen/dining-room. There I find you sitting in one of the chairs and I hand you the
    cup of coffee I just made.' OK

    No critical errors, the only thing you did not explain is where you got the information about the 4-digit passcode,
    but your directions were very detailed, so you made up for it.
