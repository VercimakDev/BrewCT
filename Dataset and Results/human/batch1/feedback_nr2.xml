            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is
            to
            mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
            meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment
            contains
            only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
            scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task:
            After
            entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer
            containing a
            jar filled with coffee beans. To the right side of the foyer you can find a living room that is filled with
            natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee table, a fireplace, a large TV and some
            artworks mounted on the walls. Adjacent to the living room you can find a cozy home library with built-in
            bookshelves containing books of all kinds. There is a table in the corner of the room, on top of it is an
            empty
            cup. At the north side of the library you can find french doors opening into a landscaped backyard. To the
            left
            side of the foyer you will find a modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the middle of it,
            surrounded by 8 chairs. I am sitting in one of those chairs with an unplugged coffee grinder in front of me.
            Further
            down the dining room you can find the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled with
            stainless
            steel appliances, granite countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops features a
            sink
            dispensing drinkable water. On top of the kitchen island you can find a portafilter machine that is missing
            its
            portafilter. The foyer also features a staircase. Upstairs you can find the private quarters. There you can
            find
            two bathrooms, a master suite and a guest suite. The master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size
            bed, a walk-in closet and a private balcony overlooking the backyard. The closet is packed with three
            drawers.
            The middle one contains a portafilter. There are several power-outlets in each room.

        I stop to take a look around the foyer. After noticing the drawer, I try to open it and find a jar of
        coffee beans. I take them with me. I look to my right and notice the living room. I go inside and search the
        room
        for something useful. After finding nothing I continue ahead to the next room a library. My eyes look over the
        room
        and all the books. I look at the table in the corner and see the cup. I go to the desk to check the cup. Its
        empty
        so I take it with me. My hands are full now. I’m continuing ahead and see the French doors with the beautiful
        view
        of a landscaped backyard. I stand still for a few seconds to take in the view. I then realize I’m at a dead end
        and
        go back to the foyer to continue my search. I see a door to the left of the entrance and go inside. I’m now in
        the
        dining room and see the coffee grinder but leave it for now because my hands are full. I pass the dining room
        and
        finally find the kitchen which has a sink where I can get water. I place down the coffee beans and the empty cup
        I
        found, then head back to get the coffee grinder and plug it into the power-outlet in the kitchen. It works. I
        take a
        look around the kitchen and find the portafilter machine, but it seems to be missing the filter. I leave the
        things
        in the kitchen and continue my search. I go back
        to the foyer and go up the stairs. I search all the bedrooms until I land in the master suite where I find a
        closet.
        I open the closet and try to open the drawers. Inside the middle one I find the missing portafilter
        . I now have all the ingredients I need to make coffee. I head back to the kitchen, grind the beans in the
        coffee
        grinder, fill the portafilter
        with the ground coffee and put the filter inside the machine. I put some water from the sink in the machine. I
        take
        the cup, wash it and place it under the spout. I then start the machine. The coffee is ready, and I bring the
        cup to
        you.

        'I stop to take a look around the foyer. After noticing the drawer, I try to open it and find a jar of

        'I look to my right and notice the living room. I go inside and search the room for something

        'My hands are full now' OK, very good observation
        'I’m continuing ahead and see the French doors with the beautiful view of a

        'I see a door to the left of the entrance and go inside. I’m now in the

        very
        advanced, good critical thinking that you can't carry everything at once
        'I pass the dining room and

        great job checking if the coffee grinder works
        'I take a

        No critical errors, also some extra observations that show good common sense, like the fact that you can't carry
        everything at once.
