            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is to
        mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
        meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment contains
        only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
        scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task: After
        entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer containing a
        jar filled with coffee beans. The drawer can only be unlocked using a 4-digit passcode. To the right side of
        the foyer you can find a living room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a
        designer coffee table, a fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. On top of the fireplace
        you can find an empty cup. Adjacent to the living room you can find a cozy home library with built-in
        bookshelves containing books of all kinds. Between two of the books, you can find a key. There is a table in the
        corner of the room, on top of it is a portafilter machine that is missing its portafilter. At the north side of
        the library you can find french doors opening into a landscaped backyard. To the left side of the foyer you will
        find a modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the middle of it, surrounded by 8 chairs. I am
        sitting in one of those chairs holding a phone charger in my right hand. Further down the dining room you can
        find
        the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled with stainless steel appliances, granite
        countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops features a sink dispensing water that is
        not drinkable. On top of the kitchen island you can find a bottle of drinkable water. Next to it, you can find a
        giant fridge with lots of sticky notes on its surface. One of them read: “The code is 3067”. The foyer also
        features a staircase. Upstairs you can find the private quarters. There you can find two bathrooms, a master
        suite and a guest suite. Inside the bathroom to your left-hand side, you can find a toothbrush that looks like
        it has been used. It is placed on top of the bathroom sink. Next to it an unplugged coffee grinder is placed.
        The master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size bed, a walk-in closet and a private balcony
        overlooking the backyard. The closet is packed with three drawers. The middle one contains a dirty portafilter.
        There are several power-outlets in each room.

        Since I'm standing in front of the house, the first thing I would do is enter the house through the front
    door and stay in the foyer. Next, I would go to the foyer drawer and enter the four-digit code (3067) to get the jar
    of beans I need to make coffee. Then I would go to the room on the right side of the foyer and grab the empty coffee
    cup on top of the fireplace. Next, I would walk from the living room back into the foyer and continue left through
    the dining room into the kitchen and place the empty cup and coffee beans on the empty kitchen countertop. Next, I
    would head back to the foyer and walk up the stairs to the private quarters, where I would enter the bathroom on the
    left to pick up the coffee grinder. Then I would go into the master room to pick up a dirty portafilter
    from the middle drawer of the closet. Now I would go back down the stairs into the foyer, dining room and then into
    the kitchen. Here I would first place the coffee grinder on the kitchen worktop and turn on the tap to clean the
    dirty portafilter
    with the non-drinkable water. I would then let the portafilter
    dry and in the meantime plug in the coffee grinder, fill it with the coffee beans I brought with me and grind them.
    When the portafilter
    is dry, I would fill it with the coffee powder from the coffee grinder and take it with me along with the empty cup
    and the drinking bottle with the drinking water. Now I would go with these two objects through the foyer into the
    living room and further into the home library. There I would place the empty cup under the coffee drain of the
    machine on the table in the corner (where the coffee machine is located) and insert the filled portafilter
    into the machine. Next, I would open the water bottle and refill the water if necessary. Now I would turn on the
    coffee maker and wait until the cup is completely filled. Then I would walk back through the living room and foyer
    into the dining room with the coffee cup and give it to you in your left hand since the other is already holding
    something.

    'Then I would go to the room on the right side of the foyer and grab the empty coffee
    cup on top of the fireplace.' OK
    'Next, I would walk from the living room back into the foyer and continue left through
    the dining room into the kitchen and place the empty cup and coffee beans on the empty kitchen countertop.' OK, good
    thinking about not carrying everything around with you, limited things you can carry at once
    'Next, I would head back to the foyer and walk up the stairs to the private quarters, where I would enter the

    'I would then let the portafilter dry and in the meantime plug in the coffee grinder, fill it with the coffee beans
    I brought with me and grind them.' OK
    'When the portafilter is dry, I would fill it with the coffee powder from the coffee grinder and take it with me

    'Now I would go with these two objects through the foyer into the living room and further into the home library.'
    OK, but actually those are three objects: portafilter, cup and bottle
    'There I would place the empty cup under the coffee drain of the
    machine on the table in the corner (where the coffee machine is located) and insert the filled portafilter
    into the machine. Next, I would open the water bottle and refill the water if necessary.' OK, good job checking the
    water level
    'Now I would turn on the
    coffee maker and wait until the cup is completely filled. Then I would walk back through the living room and foyer
    into the dining room with the coffee cup and give it to you in your left hand since the other is already holding
    something.' OK, good thinking about the free hand

    No critical errors, you just miscounted the objects you were carrying at one point, but it didn't affect the
    outcome, also you tried not to carry everything at once, which is good. You also checked the water level, which is
    important.
