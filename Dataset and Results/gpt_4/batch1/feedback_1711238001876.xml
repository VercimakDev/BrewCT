            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is
            to
            mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
            meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment
            contains
            only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
            scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task:
            After
            entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. To the right side of the foyer you can find
            a
            living room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee table, a
            fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. One of the artworks contains some text: “The
            code
            is lost”. On top of the fireplace you can find a portafilter machine that is missing its portafilter.
            Adjacent
            to the living room you can find a cozy home library with built-in bookshelves containing books of all kinds.
            Between two of the books, you can find a key. There is a table in the corner of the room, on top of it is an
            empty cup. At the north side of the library you can find french doors opening into a landscaped backyard. To
            the
            left side of the foyer you will find a modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the middle of
            it,
            surrounded by 8 chairs. I am sitting in one of those chairs holding a phone charger in my right hand.
            Further down
            the dining room you can find the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled with stainless
            steel
            appliances, granite countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops features a sink
            dispensing water that is not drinkable. On top of the kitchen island you can find a jar filled with coffee
            beans. Next to it, you can find a giant fridge with lots of sticky notes on its surface. One of them read:
            “Please do not forget that the code was changed to 4550”. The foyer also features a staircase. Upstairs you
            can
            find the private quarters. There you can find two bathrooms, a master suite and a guest suite. Inside the
            bathroom to your left-hand side, you can find a toothbrush that looks like it has been used. It is placed on
            top
            of the bathroom sink. Next to it an unplugged coffee grinder is placed. The master suite offers a generous
            bedroom with a king-size bed, a walk-in closet and a private balcony overlooking the backyard. The closet is
            packed with three drawers. The middle one contains a bottle of drinkable water. The left one contains a
            dirty
            portafilter. The left drawer can only be unlocked using a 4-digit passcode. There are several power-outlets
            in
            each room.

        Given the details of the house and the task at hand, here's how I would proceed to prepare a cup of coffee:

        1. **Entering the House:** After stepping through the front door into the foyer, I take a moment to orient
        myself with the layout of the house.

        2. **Finding the Portafilter:** Knowing that the portafilter machine on top of the fireplace in the living room
        is missing its portafilter, my first task is to locate it. I head to the master suite's walk-in closet as
        described. I find the left drawer and recall the sticky note on the fridge which mentioned the code was changed
        to "4550." I input this code to unlock the drawer and retrieve the dirty portafilter.

        3. **Cleaning the Portafilter:** Since the portafilter is dirty, I need to clean it. I head to the kitchen, but
        remember the sink water is not drinkable. Assuming the water's only issue is with consumption and not for
        cleaning, I rinse the portafilter under the kitchen sink, making sure it's clean and ready for use. If the water
        is entirely unusable, I'd use the bottle of drinkable water from the master suite’s closet for rinsing,
        sparingly.

        4. **Grinding Coffee Beans:** Next, I need to grind the coffee beans found on the kitchen island. I remember the
        coffee grinder is unplugged in the bathroom. I retrieve the coffee grinder, plug it into one of the many power
        outlets in the kitchen, and grind the coffee beans to the appropriate coarseness for the portafilter machine.

        5. **Preparing the Coffee Machine:** I return to the living room with the ground coffee and cleaned portafilter.
        I fill the portafilter with the ground coffee, making sure to tamp it down evenly for a good extraction.

        6. **Brewing the Coffee:** Assuming the portafilter machine is ready for use (plugged in and preheated, as no
        details suggest otherwise), I attach the portafilter to the machine. I place the empty cup from the library
        under the spout of the machine (after bringing it to the living room and giving it a quick rinse with the
        drinkable water to ensure it's clean). I start the brewing process.

        7. **Serving the Coffee:** Once the coffee is brewed, I take the freshly prepared cup of coffee to the dining
        room, where you are sitting with the phone charger in hand. I place the coffee on the mahogany table within your
        reach.

        Throughout this process, I've made a few assumptions based on the details provided:
        - The water from the sink, although not drinkable, is suitable for cleaning purposes.
        - The electrical outlets are functional, allowing me to plug in and use the coffee grinder.
        - The portafilter machine is operational and ready for use once the portafilter is attached.

        This detailed approach ensures that I've used the environment and the objects described to

        '1. **Entering the House:** After stepping through the front door into the foyer, I take a moment to orient
        myself with the layout of the house' OK
        '2. **Finding the Portafilter:** Knowing that the portafilter machine on top of the fireplace in the living room
        is missing its portafilter, my first task is to locate it. I head to the master suite's walk-in closet as

        to "4550." I input this code to unlock the drawer and retrieve the dirty portafilter.' OK, no direction where
        given, therefore skipped a big part of the challenge.
        '3. **Cleaning the Portafilter:** Since the portafilter is dirty, I need to clean it. I head to the kitchen, but
        remember the sink water is not drinkable. Assuming the water's only issue is with consumption and not for

        is entirely unusable, I'd use the bottle of drinkable water from the master suite’s closet for rinsing,
        sparingly.' OK, but still no directions
        '4. **Grinding Coffee Beans:** Next, I need to grind the coffee beans found on the kitchen island. I remember
        the coffee grinder is unplugged in the bathroom. I retrieve the coffee grinder, plug it into one of the many
        power outlets in the kitchen, and grind the coffee beans to the appropriate coarseness for the portafilter
        machine.' OK, no directions, not mentioned putting the beans inside the grinder, do you grind all the beans?
        '5. **Preparing the Coffee Machine:** I return to the living room with the ground coffee and cleaned
        portafilter. I fill the portafilter with the ground coffee, making sure to tamp it down evenly for a good
        extraction.' OK, why not do it in the kitchen? You might spill some ground coffee.
        '6. **Brewing the Coffee:** Assuming the portafilter machine is ready for use (plugged in and preheated, as no
        details suggest otherwise), I attach the portafilter to the machine. I place the empty cup from the library
        under the spout of the machine (after bringing it to the living room and giving it a quick rinse with the
        drinkable water to ensure it's clean). I start the brewing process.' OK, but you could still check the water
        tank of the machine. Where exactly was the cup located on the library?
        '7. **Serving the Coffee:** Once the coffee is brewed, I take the freshly prepared cup of coffee to the dining
        room, where you are sitting with the phone charger in hand. I place the coffee on the mahogany table within your
        reach.' OK

        No critical errors but very vage directions and water tank not checked just assumed to be filled.
