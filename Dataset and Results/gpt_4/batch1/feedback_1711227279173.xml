            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is
            to
            mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
            meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment
            contains
            only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
            scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task:
            After
            entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer
            containing a
            jar filled with coffee beans. To the right side of the foyer you can find a living room that is filled with
            natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee table, a fireplace, a large TV and some
            artworks mounted on the walls. Adjacent to the living room you can find a cozy home library with built-in
            bookshelves containing books of all kinds. There is a table in the corner of the room, on top of it is an
            empty
            cup. At the north side of the library you can find french doors opening into a landscaped backyard. To the
            left
            side of the foyer you will find a modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the middle of it,
            surrounded by 8 chairs. I am sitting in one of those chairs with an unplugged coffee grinder in front of me.
            Further
            down the dining room you can find the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled with
            stainless
            steel appliances, granite countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops features a
            sink
            dispensing drinkable water. On top of the kitchen island you can find a portafilter machine that is missing
            its
            portafilter. The foyer also features a staircase. Upstairs you can find the private quarters. There you can
            find
            two bathrooms, a master suite and a guest suite. The master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size
            bed, a walk-in closet and a private balcony overlooking the backyard. The closet is packed with three
            drawers.
            The middle one contains a portafilter. There are several power-outlets in each room.

        Given the details provided, here's how I would prepare a cup of coffee for you:

        1. **Retrieve the Coffee Beans**: First, I would head to the foyer and open the drawer to take out the jar
        filled with coffee beans.

        2. **Find the Portafilter**: Next, I would make my way upstairs to the master suite, locate the walk-in closet,
        and open the middle drawer to retrieve the portafilter.

        3. **Grind the Coffee Beans**: With the coffee beans and portafilter in hand, I would return to the dining room
        where you are sitting with the unplugged coffee grinder. I would plug in the coffee grinder to one of the power
        outlets in the dining room and grind the coffee beans to the appropriate coarseness for the portafilter machine.
        After grinding, I would fill the portafilter with the freshly ground coffee.

        4. **Prepare the Portafilter Machine**: I would carry the filled portafilter to the kitchen and attach it to the
        portafilter machine that's on top of the kitchen island.

        5. **Heat Water**: Assuming the portafilter machine heats water as part of its functionality (since no kettle or
        alternative method of heating water was mentioned), I would turn on the machine to heat the water to the right
        temperature for brewing espresso.

        6. **Fetch the Cup**: While the machine is heating, I would go to the home library to get the empty cup waiting
        on the table in the corner.

        7. **Brew the Coffee**: Returning to the kitchen, I would place the cup under the portafilter on the machine and
        start the espresso brewing process.

        8. **Serve the Coffee**: Once the coffee is brewed, I would carefully carry the cup back to the dining room and
        serve it to you, ensuring not to spill any on the mahogany table or the floor.

        Throughout this process, I would make sure to move efficiently between rooms, paying close attention to the
        details of the house layout and the task at hand to avoid any mistakes, ensuring that you receive a perfectly
        brewed cup of coffee.
