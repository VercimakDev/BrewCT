            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is
            to
            mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
            meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment
            contains
            only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
            scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task:
            After
            entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer
            containing a
            dirty portafilter. The drawer can only be unlocked using a 4-digit passcode. To the right side of the foyer
            you can find a living room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer
            coffee
            table, a fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. One of the artworks contains some
            text:
            “The code is 3637”. On top of the fireplace you can find an empty cup. Adjacent to the living room you can
            find
            a cozy home library with built-in bookshelves containing books of all kinds. Between two of the books, you
            can
            find a key. There is a table in the corner of the room, on top of it is a portafilter machine that is
            missing
            its portafilter. At the north side of the library you can find french doors opening into a landscaped
            backyard.
            To the left side of the foyer you will find a modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the
            middle
            of it, surrounded by 8 chairs. I am sitting in one of those chairs holding a phone charger in my right hand.
            Further
            down the dining room you can find the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled with
            stainless
            steel appliances, granite countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops features a
            sink
            dispensing water that is not drinkable. On top of the kitchen island you can find a jar filled with coffee
            beans. Next to it, you can find a giant fridge with lots of sticky notes on its surface. One of them read:
            “Buy
            1208 apples please”. The foyer also features a staircase. Upstairs you can find the private quarters. There
            you
            can find two bathrooms, a master suite and a guest suite. Inside the bathroom to your left-hand side, you
            can
            find a toothbrush that looks like it has been used. It is placed on top of the bathroom sink. Next to it an
            unplugged coffee grinder is placed. The master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size bed, a
            walk-in
            closet and a private balcony overlooking the backyard. The closet is packed with three drawers. The middle
            one
            contains a bottle of drinkable water. There are several power-outlets in each room.

        Given the details provided, I will now proceed with preparing a cup of coffee for you, following the steps
        below:

        1. **Unlock the Drawer in the Foyer**
        - First, I head to the foyer and approach the drawer containing the dirty portafilter. Utilizing the clue from
        the artwork in the living room which states, “The code is 3637”, I input 3637 as the passcode to unlock the
        drawer. I retrieve the dirty portafilter.

        2. **Clean the Portafilter**
        - Since the kitchen has a sink, but the water is not drinkable, I need to find an alternative source of water to
        clean the portafilter. Given the scenario does not explicitly mention a cleaning station, I will proceed to the
        master suite to fetch the bottle of drinkable water from the closet drawer. I use some of this water to rinse
        and clean the portafilter in the kitchen sink, making sure it's ready for use.

        3. **Collect the Key from the Library**
        - I head to the cozy home library and locate the key nestled between two books on the built-in bookshelves. This
        key will be used later in the process if necessary.

        4. **Prepare the Coffee Grinder**
        - In the bathroom to the left-hand side, I find the unplugged coffee grinder next to a used toothbrush. I take
        the coffee grinder to the kitchen, where I find several power outlets. I plug the grinder into one of these
        outlets.

        5. **Grind the Coffee Beans**
        - On the kitchen island, there is a jar filled with coffee beans. I open the jar and pour an appropriate amount
        of beans into the coffee grinder. After adjusting the grinder to the correct grind size for the portafilter
        machine, I grind the beans.

        6. **Brew the Coffee**
        - With the freshly ground coffee, I fill the cleaned portafilter, making sure to tamp the grounds evenly for a
        good extraction. I then attach the portafilter to the portafilter machine located on the table in the corner of
        the library. Assuming the machine has water and is ready for use (since this detail is not provided, I'm
        assuming basic functionalities are in place), I begin the brewing process.

        7. **Retrieve the Cup**
        - While the coffee is brewing, I head back to the living room to retrieve the empty cup from atop the fireplace.

        8. **Serve the Coffee**
        - Once the coffee is brewed, I carefully pour the freshly made coffee into the cup.

        9. **Final Touches and Serving**
        - With the coffee prepared, I return to the dining room where you are sitting with a phone charger in hand. I
        place the hot cup of coffee on the mahogany table within your reach, completing the task.

        At each step, I've made sure to use only the items and features explicitly mentioned in your description,
        adhering to the constraints of the scenario

        the library, the assumtion is fine but you did not place a cup under the portafilter, otherwise all the coffee
        is spilled.

        '9. **Final Touches and Serving**
        - With the coffee prepared, I return to the dining room where you are sitting with a phone charger in hand. I
        place the hot cup of coffee on the mahogany table within your reach, completing the task.' OK
        Critical error, cup was not under the portafilter, therefore the coffee was spilled. Also almost no directions
        were given.
