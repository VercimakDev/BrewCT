            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is
            to
            mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
            meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment
            contains
            only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
            scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task:
            After
            entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer
            containing
            toothpaste. The drawer can only be unlocked using a 4-digit passcode. To the right side of the foyer you can
            find a living room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee
            table,
            a fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. One of the artworks contains some text: “The
            code is not here”. On top of the fireplace you can find a jar filled with coffee beans. Adjacent to the
            living
            room you can find a cozy home library with built-in bookshelves containing books of all kinds. Between two
            of
            the books, you can find a key. There is a table in the corner of the room, on top of it is an unplugged
            coffee
            grinder. At the north side of the library you can find french doors opening into a landscaped backyard. In
            the
            backyard you can find an outdoor table, on top of it a dirty cup is placed. To the left side of the foyer
            you
            will find a modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the middle of it, surrounded by 8 chairs.
            I
            am sitting in one of those chairs holding a bottle of drinkable water in my right hand. Further down the
            dining
            room
            you can find the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled with stainless steel appliances,
            granite countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops features a sink dispensing
            water
            that is not drinkable. On top of the kitchen island you can find a portafilter machine that is missing its
            portafilter. Next to it, you can find a giant fridge with lots of sticky notes on its surface. One of them
            read:
            “Please do not forget that the code was changed to 4150”. The foyer also features a staircase. Upstairs you
            can
            find the private quarters. There you can find two bathrooms, a master suite and a guest suite. Inside the
            bathroom to your left-hand side, you can find a toothbrush that looks like it has been used. It is placed on
            top
            of the bathroom sink. The master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size bed, a walk-in closet and
            a
            private balcony overlooking the backyard. The closet is packed with three drawers. The middle one contains a
            portafilter. There are several power-outlets in each room.

        To prepare a cup of coffee for you, I will follow these steps meticulously, based on the description of
        the house you provided:

        1. **Retrieve the Portafilter**: First, I head upstairs to the private quarters to find the master suite. Inside
        the
        walk-in closet, I locate the middle drawer containing the portafilter. I take the portafilter for the coffee
        machine.

        2. **Unlock the Drawer in the Foyer**: Knowing the passcode is 4150, thanks to the sticky note on the fridge, I
        go
        back downstairs to the foyer. I input the code '4150' into the drawer to unlock it. Inside, I find the
        toothpaste,
        which is not needed for making coffee, but it's good to confirm the drawer is now unlocked.

        3. **Grind the Coffee Beans**: I move to the cozy home library next to the living room. I take the key found
        between
        two books on the built-in bookshelves. Then, I plug in the coffee grinder that is on the table in the corner of
        the
        room. I go back to the living room, retrieve the jar filled with coffee beans from the top of the fireplace, and
        return to the library to grind the beans using the coffee grinder. After grinding, I ensure the ground coffee is
        placed back into a container or the portafilter directly, ready for brewing.

        4. **Clean the Cup**: With the ground coffee ready, I remember the dirty cup on the outdoor table in the
        backyard. I
        go outside through the French doors in the library, take the dirty cup, and bring it back inside. I head to the
        kitchen and wash the cup thoroughly in the sink, using water from the bottle you're holding in the dining room,
        since the kitchen sink dispenses water that's not drinkable.

        5. **Brew the Coffee**: With the clean cup and ground coffee ready, I place the portafilter into the portafilter
        machine on the kitchen island. I make sure it's properly attached and start the machine to brew the coffee
        directly
        into the clean cup.

        6. **Serve the Coffee**: Once the coffee is brewed, I take the freshly prepared cup of coffee and bring it to
        you,
        sitting at the mahogany table in the dining room.

        Throughout this process, I've used only the items and features you've described in the house to ensure the task
        is
        completed accurately and to your satisfaction.

        '1. **Retrieve the Portafilter**: First, I head upstairs to the private quarters to find the master suite.
        Inside the walk-in closet, I locate the middle drawer containing the portafilter. I take the portafilter for the
        coffee machine.' OK, but you did not mention being in the foyer or entering the house
        '2. **Unlock the Drawer in the Foyer**: Knowing the passcode is 4150, thanks to the sticky note on the fridge, I
        go
        back downstairs to the foyer. I input the code '4150' into the drawer to unlock it. Inside, I find the
        toothpaste,
        which is not needed for making coffee, but it's good to confirm the drawer is now unlocked.' OK,but as you said,
        this was not needed.
        '3. **Grind the Coffee Beans**: I move to the cozy home library next to the living room. I take the key found
        between two books on the built-in bookshelves. Then, I plug in the coffee grinder that is on the table in the
        corner
        of the room. I go back to the living room, retrieve the jar filled with coffee beans from the top of the
        fireplace,
        and return to the library to grind the beans using the coffee grinder. After grinding, I ensure the ground
        coffee is
        placed back into a container or the portafilter directly, ready for brewing.' OK, but there is no container, you
        would have to use the portafilter.
        '4. **Clean the Cup**: With the ground coffee ready, I remember the dirty cup on the outdoor table in the
        backyard.
        I go outside through the French doors in the library, take the dirty cup, and bring it back inside. I head to
        the
        kitchen and wash the cup thoroughly in the sink, using water from the bottle you're holding in the dining room,
        since the kitchen sink dispenses water that's not drinkable.' OK, no directions given on how you got into the
        kitchen.
        '5. **Brew the Coffee**: With the clean cup and ground coffee ready, I place the portafilter into the
        portafilter
        machine on the kitchen island. I make sure it's properly attached and start the machine to brew the coffee
        directly
        into the clean cup.' OK, but where exactly did you place the cup? You did not check if the machine has any
        water.
        Also it does not sound as if the ground coffee is inside the portafilter as you never clarified that it is.
        '6. **Serve the Coffee**: Once the coffee is brewed, I take the freshly prepared cup of coffee and bring it to
        you,
        sitting at the mahogany table in the dining room.' OK

        No critical error, but very vage descriptions, not even sure if the ground coffee is inside the portafilter,
        water
        was also not checked.
