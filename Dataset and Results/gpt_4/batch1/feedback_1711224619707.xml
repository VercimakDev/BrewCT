            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is to
        mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
        meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment contains
        only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
        scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task: After
        entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer containing a
        portafilter there. To the right side of the foyer you can find a living room that is filled with natural light.
        There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee table, a fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on
        the walls. Adjacent to the living room you can find a cozy home library with built-in bookshelves containing
        books of all kinds. There is a table in the corner of the room, on top of it is a jar filled with coffee beans.
        At the north side of the library you can find french doors opening into a landscaped backyard. To the left side
        of the foyer you will find a modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the middle of it, surrounded
        by 8 chairs. I am sitting in one of those chairs with an empty cup in my right hand. Further down the dining
        room
        you can find the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled with stainless steel appliances,
        granite countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops features a sink dispensing
        drinkable water. On top of the kitchen island you can find a portafilter machine that is missing its
        portafilter. The foyer also features a staircase. Upstairs you can find the private quarters. There you can find
        two bathrooms, a master suite and a guest suite. The master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size
        bed, a walk-in closet and a private balcony overlooking the backyard. The closet is packed with three drawers.
        The left one contains an unplugged coffee grinder. There are several power-outlets in each room.

        Given the detailed description of the house and the task at hand, I will now proceed to prepare a cup of
    coffee for you. Here are the steps I will take to accomplish this task:

    1. **Retrieve the Portafilter**: Upon entering the foyer, I immediately notice the drawer containing the
    portafilter. I open the drawer and take the portafilter out.

    2. **Find the Coffee Beans**: I remember seeing a jar filled with coffee beans in the home library. I walk towards
    the library, locate the jar on the table in the corner, and take it.

    3. **Grind the Coffee Beans**: Knowing that the coffee grinder is in the master suite's walk-in closet, I head
    upstairs to the private quarters. I find the master suite, enter the walk-in closet, and locate the drawer on the
    left which contains the unplugged coffee grinder. I take the coffee grinder out and look for a power outlet in the
    master suite to plug it in. Once plugged in, I pour some coffee beans from the jar into the grinder and grind them
    to the appropriate coarseness for the portafilter machine.

    4. **Prepare the Portafilter**: After grinding the coffee beans, I ensure the portafilter is clean and then fill it
    with the freshly ground coffee. I gently tap it on the counter to settle the grounds and then press them down with a
    tamper (assuming the back of a spoon or any flat surface available if a tamper is not mentioned in the description).

    5. **Brew the Coffee**: With the portafilter ready, I head back downstairs to the kitchen, where the portafilter
    machine is located on the kitchen island. I insert the prepared portafilter into the machine. I ensure the machine
    is plugged into one of the power outlets in the kitchen and then turn it on to heat up. Once the machine is ready, I
    place a cup (assuming the empty cup in your hand is meant for the coffee) under the spout and start the brewing
    process.

    6. **Serve the Coffee**: After the coffee has been brewed into the cup, I carefully take it from under the spout. I
    then walk over to where you are sitting in the dining room with an empty cup in your right hand. I gently place the
    freshly brewed cup of coffee on the table in front of you or hand it directly to you, depending on your preference.

    Throughout this process, I have paid meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that each step is carried out with
    care to deliver a freshly brewed cup of coffee using the specific elements provided in the house's description.
    Enjoy your coffee!

    How am i sitting there with the empty cup if you already took it?

    No critical errors but cup was never retrieved and still in my hand at the end. Also water in the machine tank was
    not checked.
