            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is
            to
            mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
            meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment
            contains
            only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
            scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task:
            After
            entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer
            containing
            white socks. The drawer can only be unlocked using a key. To the right side of the foyer you can find a
            living
            room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee table, a
            fireplace, a
            large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. On top of the fireplace you can find an empty cup. Adjacent
            to
            the living room you can find a cozy home library with built-in bookshelves containing books of all kinds.
            Between two of the books, you can find a jar filled with coffee beans. There is a table in the corner of the
            room, on top of it is a portafilter machine that is missing its portafilter. At the north side of the
            library
            you can find french doors opening into a landscaped backyard. To the left side of the foyer you will find a
            modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the middle of it, surrounded by 8 chairs. I am
            sitting in
            of those chairs holding a dirty portafilter in my right hand. Further down the dining room you can find the
            heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled with stainless steel appliances, granite
            countertops
            and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops features a sink dispensing water that is not
            drinkable. On top of the kitchen island you can find a bottle of drinkable water. The foyer also features a
            staircase. Upstairs you can find the private quarters. There you can find two bathrooms, a master suite and
            a
            guest suite. Inside the bathroom to your left-hand side, you can find a key that looks like it is designed
            to
            open a drawer. It is placed on top of the bathroom sink. Next to it an unplugged coffee grinder is placed.
            The
            master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size bed, a walk-in closet and a private balcony
            overlooking
            the backyard. The closet is packed with three drawers. The middle one contains a phone charger. There are
            several power-outlets in each room.

        1. Begin by heading directly upstairs to the bathroom on the left-hand side to retrieve the key from the top of
        the bathroom sink.
        2. While in the bathroom, take the unplugged coffee grinder next to the key.
        3. Return downstairs to the foyer and use the retrieved key to unlock the drawer containing the white socks.
        4. Head into the modern dining room where you are sitting with the dirty portafilter in your hand.
        5. Politely ask for the dirty portafilter, indicating that it's required for making coffee.
        6. Proceed to the open-concept kitchen with the portafilter. Rinse it thoroughly under the tap over the sink to
        clean it, even though the water is not drinkable, the cleaning doesn't require potable water.
        7. Now, find a cloth or a piece of kitchen towel to dry the portafilter completely.
        8. Move to the kitchen island and take the bottle of drinkable water.
        9. Go to the home library and fill the coffee machine's reservoir with the drinkable water from the bottle.
        10. Plug in the coffee grinder you brought from the bathroom to a power outlet in the library.
        11. Retrieve the jar filled with coffee beans between two books on the bookshelf.
        12. Pour an appropriate amount of coffee beans into the grinder and grind them to the right consistency for the
        portafilter machine.
        13. Fill the cleaned portafilter with the freshly ground coffee, tamping it down lightly.
        14. Attach the portafilter to the machine, ensuring it is secure.
        15. Place the empty cup from atop the fireplace under the portafilter spouts.
        16. Start the portafilter machine to brew the coffee, letting the hot, freshly made coffee fill the cup.
        17. Once the brewing process is complete, remove the cup of coffee.
        18. Serve the freshly made cup of coffee to you, sitting in the dining room, completing the task with attention
        to detail and ensuring the coffee is served hot and aromatic.

        '1. Begin by heading directly upstairs to the bathroom on the left-hand side to retrieve the key from the top of
        the bathroom sink.' OK, but not mentioned to enter the home or stating in the foyer, why do you even need the
        key?
        '2. While in the bathroom, take the unplugged coffee grinder next to the key.' OK
        '3. Return downstairs to the foyer and use the retrieved key to unlock the drawer containing the white socks.'
        OK, but you really do not need them.
        '4. Head into the modern dining room where you are sitting with the dirty portafilter in your hand.' OK, but no

        clean it, even though the water is not drinkable, the cleaning doesn't require potable water.' OK, you are right
        about the water.
        '7. Now, find a cloth or a piece of kitchen towel to dry the portafilter completely.' There is no such thing, as
        I did not mention it in the description, just let it dry a few minutes?
        '8. Move to the kitchen island and take the bottle of drinkable water.' OK
        '9. Go to the home library and fill the coffee machine's reservoir with the drinkable water from the bottle.'
        OK, directions to library not given, where is the machine exactly?
        '10. Plug in the coffee grinder you brought from the bathroom to a power outlet in the library.' OK
        '11. Retrieve the jar filled with coffee beans between two books on the bookshelf.' OK
        '12. Pour an appropriate amount of coffee beans into the grinder and grind them to the right consistency for the
        portafilter machine.' OK
        '13. Fill the cleaned portafilter with the freshly ground coffee, tamping it down lightly.' OK, hope you do not
        spill in the library.
        '14. Attach the portafilter to the machine, ensuring it is secure.' OK, where is the machine exactly?
        '15. Place the empty cup from atop the fireplace under the portafilter spouts.' OK

        to detail and ensuring the coffee is served hot and aromatic.' OK, direction not given.

        No critical errors but many informations not given, or not detailed enough. Also some useless actions like
        retrieving the socks from the drawer.
