            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is
            to
            mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
            meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment
            contains
            only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
            scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task:
            After
            entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer
            containing a
            dirty portafilter. The drawer can only be unlocked using a key. To the right side of the foyer you can find
            a
            living room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee table, a
            fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. Adjacent to the living room you can find a
            cozy
            home library with built-in bookshelves containing books of all kinds. Between two of the books, you can find
            a
            cup filled with drinkable water. There is a table in the corner of the room, on top of it is a plugged in
            coffee
            grinder. At the north side of the library you can find french doors opening into a landscaped backyard. To
            the
            left side of the foyer you will find a modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the middle of
            it,
            surrounded by 8 chairs. I am sitting in one of those chairs holding a jar filled with coffee beans in my
            left hand.
            Further down the dining room you can find the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled
            with
            stainless steel appliances, granite countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops
            features a sink dispensing water that is not drinkable. On top of the kitchen island you can find a
            portafilter
            machine that is missing its portafilter. The foyer also features a staircase. Upstairs you can find the
            private
            quarters. There you can find two bathrooms, a master suite and a guest suite. Inside the bathroom to your
            left-hand side,
            you can find a key that looks like it is designed to open a drawer. It is placed on top of the
            bathroom sink. The master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size bed, a walk-in closet and a
            private
            balcony overlooking the backyard. The closet is packed with three drawers. The left one contains white
            socks.
            There are several power-outlets in each room.

        To prepare a cup of coffee in this meticulously described environment, I will follow these steps:

        1. **Retrieve the Key**: I’ll start by heading upstairs to the bathroom on the left-hand side to retrieve the
        key that's placed on top of the bathroom sink. This key is designed to open a drawer which, based on the
        description, is likely to be the one in the foyer containing the dirty portafilter.

        2. **Get the Portafilter**: With the key in hand, I descend the staircase back to the foyer. I use the key to
        unlock the drawer and retrieve the dirty portafilter.

        3. **Clean the Portafilter**: Since the kitchen sink dispenses water that is not drinkable and there is no
        explicit mention of cleaning supplies, I will use the cup of drinkable water found between two books in the home
        library to rinse the portafilter. I assume that since no cleaning materials were mentioned, the portafilter just
        needs a rinse to be considered clean for our purposes.

        4. **Grind the Coffee Beans**: I then approach you in the dining room to politely request the jar filled with
        coffee beans. With the coffee beans now in my possession, I proceed to the home library and use the plugged-in
        coffee grinder on the table to grind the beans to the appropriate size for the portafilter machine.

        5. **Prepare the Coffee Machine**: I take the cleaned portafilter and the ground coffee to the kitchen. I fill
        the portafilter with the ground coffee, ensuring it's properly tamped down for an even extraction.

        6. **Brew the Coffee**: I insert the prepared portafilter into the portafilter machine on top of the kitchen
        island. Since the environment only contains elements explicitly described and there’s no mention of the
        machine's water reservoir being empty or the machine being unplugged, I proceed under the assumption that the
        machine is ready for use with water already filled and the machine turned on. I place a cup (assuming a standard
        kitchen would have cups, but since no cups were mentioned, I might have to use the same cup from the library
        after rinsing it with the non-drinkable water from the kitchen sink just for the sake of following instructions)
        under the portafilter spout and start the brewing process.

        7. **Serve the Coffee**: Once the coffee is brewed, I carefully carry the cup back to the dining room where you
        are seated. I serve the freshly prepared cup of coffee, completing the task with attention to the details
        provided in the environment.

        Throughout this process, I have made a few assumptions based on the instructions and the environment described.
        The primary challenge was the lack of explicit mention of certain items typically used in coffee preparation
        (like a clean cup directly mentioned for the coffee, or explicit cleaning supplies for the portafilter), leading
        to creative solutions within the given constraints.

        '1. **Retrieve the Key**: I’ll start by heading upstairs to the bathroom on the left-hand side to retrieve the

        entering the home
        '2. **Get the Portafilter**: With the key in hand, I descend the staircase back to the foyer. I use the key to
        unlock the drawer and retrieve the dirty portafilter. ' OK
        '3. **Clean the Portafilter**: Since the kitchen sink dispenses water that is not drinkable and there is no
        explicit mention of cleaning supplies, I will use the cup of drinkable water found between two books in the home
        library to rinse the portafilter. I assume that since no cleaning materials were mentioned, the portafilter just
        needs a rinse to be considered clean for our purposes.' OK, I do believe that non drinkable water can still be
        used to clean stuff, but assumption that a rinse is enough is alright, do you rinse above the sink? Otherwise
        water is spilled.
        '4. **Grind the Coffee Beans**: I then approach you in the dining room to politely request the jar filled with
        coffee beans. With the coffee beans now in my possession, I proceed to the home library and use the plugged-in
        coffee grinder on the table to grind the beans to the appropriate size for the portafilter machine.' OK, but did
        not give directions to the library.
        '5. **Prepare the Coffee Machine**: I take the cleaned portafilter and the ground coffee to the kitchen. I fill
        the portafilter with the ground coffee, ensuring it's properly tamped down for an even extraction.' OK. but no
        directions to the kitchen given.
        '6. **Brew the Coffee**: I insert the prepared portafilter into the portafilter machine on top of the kitchen
        island. Since the environment only contains elements explicitly described and there’s no mention of the

        after rinsing it with the non-drinkable water from the kitchen sink just for the sake of following instructions)
        under the portafilter spout and start the brewing process.' OK, assumtion with machine is well, you need to use
        the cup from the library, why is the non-drinkable water ok for you to clean suddenly? Not explicitly mentioned
        retrieving the cup.
        '7. **Serve the Coffee**: Once the coffee is brewed, I carefully carry the cup back to the dining room where you
        are seated. I serve the freshly prepared cup of coffee, completing the task with attention to the details
        provided in the environment.' OK

        No critical errors, some minor ones like not mentioning retrieving the cup or rinsing above the sink.
