            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is
            to
            mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
            meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment
            contains
            only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
            scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task:
            After
            entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer
            containing a
            jar filled with coffee beans. The drawer can only be unlocked using a key. To the right side of the foyer
            you
            can find a living room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee
            table, a fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. Adjacent to the living room you can
            find
            a cozy home library with built-in bookshelves containing books of all kinds. Between two of the books, you
            can
            find a key that looks like it is designed to open a drawer. There is a table in the corner of the room, on
            top
            of it is a dirty portafilter. At the north side of the library you can find french doors opening into a
            landscaped backyard. To the left side of the foyer you will find a modern dining room with a long mahogany
            table
            right in the middle of it, surrounded by 8 chairs. I am sitting in one of those chairs with a cup that is
            filled
            with drinkable water in my left hand. Further down the dining room you can find the heart of the home - a
            spacious open-concept kitchen filled with stainless steel appliances, granite countertops and a cooking
            island in
            the middle. One of the countertops features a sink dispensing water that is not drinkable. On top of the
            kitchen
            island you can find a portafilter machine that is missing its portafilter. The foyer also features a
            staircase.
            Upstairs you can find the private quarters. There you can find two bathrooms, a master suite and a guest
            suite.
            The master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size bed, a walk-in closet and a private balcony
            overlooking the backyard. The closet is packed with three drawers. The left one contains an unplugged coffee
            grinder. There are several power-outlets in each room.

        Given the details provided, I will now mentally enter the house to prepare a cup of coffee for you, detailing
        each step of the process:

        1. **Entering the House and Finding the Key**: After entering through the front door, I notice the foyer and
        remember the drawer with the coffee beans that needs to be unlocked. I then head to the right, into the living
        room, making my way to the cozy home library adjacent to it. There, between two books on the built-in
        bookshelves, I find the key designed to open the drawer.

        2. **Unlocking the Drawer and Collecting the Coffee Beans**: With the key in hand, I return to the foyer and use
        the key to unlock the drawer, retrieving the jar filled with coffee beans.

        3. **Preparing the Portafilter**: I noticed a dirty portafilter on a table in the corner of the library. I take
        this portafilter to the kitchen. In the kitchen, I rinse the portafilter thoroughly in the sink, ensuring it's
        clean for use, even though the water is not drinkable, it's sufficient for cleaning purposes.

        4. **Grinding the Coffee Beans**: Carrying the jar of coffee beans, I head upstairs to the master suite's
        walk-in closet, where I find the unplugged coffee grinder in the left drawer. I plug in the coffee grinder into
        one of the power outlets in the room and grind the coffee beans to the appropriate coarseness for the
        portafilter machine.

        5. **Filling the Portafilter and Brewing the Coffee**: I take the ground coffee and the cleaned portafilter back
        downstairs to the kitchen. There, I fill the portafilter with the freshly ground coffee and tamp it down evenly.
        I then attach the portafilter to the portafilter machine on the kitchen island.

        6. **Heating Water**: I turn on the portafilter machine to heat the water. Given the machine's design, it heats
        the water to the optimal temperature for extracting espresso.

        7. **Brewing the Coffee**: Once the machine indicates it is ready, I place your cup (assuming I can use the one
        you're holding or another if available within the constraints of the scenario) under the portafilter spout and
        start the machine, allowing the hot water to pass through the ground coffee into the cup, creating a rich and
        aromatic espresso.

        8. **Final Touches and Serving**: Given the limitations of the scenario (no mention of milk, sugar, or other
        additives), I serve the freshly brewed espresso as is, bringing it to you at the mahogany table in the dining
        room, where you are seated with a cup of drinkable water in your left hand.

        Throughout this process, I've made sure to follow the details provided, using only the elements mentioned in
        your description of the house and its contents. Enjoy your coffee!

        you get to the kitchen? No directions were given.
        '4. **Grinding the Coffee Beans**: Carrying the jar of coffee beans, I head upstairs to the master suite's
        walk-in closet, where I find the unplugged coffee grinder in the left drawer. I plug in the coffee grinder into

        portafilter machine.' OK, but forgot to mention putting the beans inside the grinder.
        '5. **Filling the Portafilter and Brewing the Coffee**: I take the ground coffee and the cleaned portafilter
        back downstairs to the kitchen. There, I fill the portafilter with the freshly ground coffee and tamp it down

        '6. **Heating Water**: I turn on the portafilter machine to heat the water. Given the machine's design, it heats

        the tank.
        '7. **Brewing the Coffee**: Once the machine indicates it is ready, I place your cup (assuming I can use the one
        you're holding or another if available within the constraints of the scenario) under the portafilter spout and

        aromatic espresso.' OK but never retrieved my cup.
        '8. **Final Touches and Serving**: Given the limitations of the scenario (no mention of milk, sugar, or other
        additives), I serve the freshly brewed espresso as is, bringing it to you at the mahogany table in the dining
        room, where you are seated with a cup of drinkable water in your left hand.' OK, but inconsistent with what you
        mentioned, there are now two cups it seems.

        No critical errors but cup was never retrieved, water was not checked.
