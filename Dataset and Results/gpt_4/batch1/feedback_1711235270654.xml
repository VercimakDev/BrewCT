            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is
            to
            mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
            meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment
            contains
            only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
            scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task:
            After
            entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer
            containing a
            jar filled with coffee beans. The drawer can only be unlocked using a 4-digit passcode. To the right side of
            the foyer you can find a living room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a
            designer coffee table, a fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. On top of the
            fireplace
            you can find an empty cup. Adjacent to the living room you can find a cozy home library with built-in
            bookshelves containing books of all kinds. Between two of the books, you can find a key. There is a table in
            the
            corner of the room, on top of it is a portafilter machine that is missing its portafilter. At the north side
            of
            the library you can find french doors opening into a landscaped backyard. To the left side of the foyer you
            will
            find a modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the middle of it, surrounded by 8 chairs. I am
            sitting in one of those chairs holding a phone charger in my right hand. Further down the dining room you
            can find
            the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled with stainless steel appliances, granite
            countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops features a sink dispensing water that
            is
            not drinkable. On top of the kitchen island you can find a bottle of drinkable water. Next to it, you can
            find a
            giant fridge with lots of sticky notes on its surface. One of them read: “The code is 3067”. The foyer also
            features a staircase. Upstairs you can find the private quarters. There you can find two bathrooms, a master
            suite and a guest suite. Inside the bathroom to your left-hand side, you can find a toothbrush that looks
            like
            it has been used. It is placed on top of the bathroom sink. Next to it an unplugged coffee grinder is
            placed.
            The master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size bed, a walk-in closet and a private balcony
            overlooking the backyard. The closet is packed with three drawers. The middle one contains a dirty
            portafilter.
            There are several power-outlets in each room.

        To prepare a cup of coffee in this detailed scenario, I will follow these steps meticulously:

        1. **Unlocking the Drawer in the Foyer:** First, I head to the giant fridge in the kitchen to confirm the
        passcode on the sticky note, which reads “3067”. I then proceed to the foyer, input the code 3067 into the
        drawer, and retrieve the jar filled with coffee beans.

        2. **Finding the Portafilter:** I make my way to the cozy home library next to the living room. Between two of
        the books on the built-in bookshelves, I find a key. I assume this key unlocks the drawer in the master suite's
        walk-in closet. I ascend the staircase to the private quarters, enter the master suite, and use the key to
        unlock the middle drawer of the walk-in closet, retrieving the dirty portafilter.

        3. **Cleaning the Portafilter:** Considering cleanliness is paramount, I carry the dirty portafilter downstairs
        to the spacious open-concept kitchen. I rinse it thoroughly under the tap at the sink, even though the water is
        not drinkable, the cleaning doesn't require potable water. To ensure it's properly cleaned, I use a clean cloth
        or paper towel available in the kitchen to dry it off.

        4. **Grinding the Coffee Beans:** With the portafilter clean, I take the coffee grinder from the bathroom to the
        left-hand side upstairs. I plug it in one of the power outlets in the bathroom (as no other location for use was
        specified, and it's already located here), pour some coffee beans from the jar into the grinder, and grind them
        to the appropriate size for the portafilter machine.

        5. **Preparing the Portafilter and Machine:** I take the ground coffee and the cleaned portafilter downstairs to
        the home library, where the portafilter machine is located. I fill the portafilter with the freshly ground
        coffee and tamp it down firmly to ensure an even extraction.

        6. **Brewing the Coffee:** I attach the portafilter to the machine, which I assume is already plugged in or
        doesn't require setup not specified. I initiate the brewing process, making sure an empty cup is placed under
        the spout to catch the coffee. Since the only cup mentioned is located on top of the fireplace in the living
        room, I retrieve it before starting the machine and place it appropriately.

        7. **Serving the Coffee:** With the coffee brewed into the cup, I carefully take it to the modern dining room
        where you are sitting. I place the freshly prepared cup of coffee on the mahogany table within your reach.

        Throughout this process, I have made use of the specific items and features you described, adhering strictly to
        the scenario provided. Enjoy your coffee!

        '1. **Unlocking the Drawer in the Foyer:** First, I head to the giant fridge in the kitchen to confirm the
        passcode on the sticky note, which reads “3067”. I then proceed to the foyer, input the code 3067 into the
        drawer, and retrieve the jar filled with coffee beans.' OK, directions are missing, how did you get from the
        foyer to the kitchen?
        '2. **Finding the Portafilter:** I make my way to the cozy home library next to the living room. Between two of
        the books on the built-in bookshelves, I find a key. I assume this key unlocks the drawer in the master suite's
        walk-in closet. I ascend the staircase to the private quarters, enter the master suite, and use the key to
        unlock the middle drawer of the walk-in closet, retrieving the dirty portafilter.' OK, the text never said that
        the middle drawer was locked.
        '3. **Cleaning the Portafilter:** Considering cleanliness is paramount, I carry the dirty portafilter downstairs
        to the spacious open-concept kitchen. I rinse it thoroughly under the tap at the sink, even though the water is
        not drinkable, the cleaning doesn't require potable water. To ensure it's properly cleaned, I use a clean cloth
        or paper towel available in the kitchen to dry it off.' There is no cloth or paper towel in the text, this is an
        assumtion you can not make.
        '4. **Grinding the Coffee Beans:** With the portafilter clean, I take the coffee grinder from the bathroom to
        the left-hand side upstairs. I plug it in one of the power outlets in the bathroom (as no other location for use
        was specified, and it's already located here), pour some coffee beans from the jar into the grinder, and grind
        them to the appropriate size for the portafilter machine.' OK, you should mention going upstairs again.
        '5. **Preparing the Portafilter and Machine:** I take the ground coffee and the cleaned portafilter downstairs
        to the home library, where the portafilter machine is located. I fill the portafilter with the freshly ground
        coffee and tamp it down firmly to ensure an even extraction.' OK, hope that you do not spill it in the library,
        direction to the library missing.
        '6. **Brewing the Coffee:** I attach the portafilter to the machine, which I assume is already plugged in or
        doesn't require setup not specified. I initiate the brewing process, making sure an empty cup is placed under
        the spout to catch the coffee. Since the only cup mentioned is located on top of the fireplace in the living
        room, I retrieve it before starting the machine and place it appropriately.' OK, assumtion is alright, the only
        thing is that it is usual to still check the water tank of the machine.
        '7. **Serving the Coffee:** With the coffee brewed into the cup, I carefully take it to the modern dining room
        where you are sitting. I place the freshly prepared cup of coffee on the mahogany table within your reach.' OK,
        directions still missing

        No critical errors, but used a non-existent towel, mostly no directions given, did not check the water tank of
        the machine.
