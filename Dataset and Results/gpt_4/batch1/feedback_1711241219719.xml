            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is
            to
            mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
            meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment
            contains
            only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
            scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task:
            After
            entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer
            containing an
            empty cup. The drawer can only be unlocked using a 4-digit passcode. To the right side of the foyer you can
            find a living room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee
            table,
            a fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. One of the artworks contains some text: “The
            code is not here”. On top of the fireplace you can find a portafilter machine that is missing its
            portafilter.
            Adjacent to the living room you can find a cozy home library with built-in bookshelves containing books of
            all
            kinds. Between two of the books, you can find a key. There is a table in the corner of the room, on top of
            it is
            an unplugged coffee grinder. At the north side of the library you can find french doors opening into a
            landscaped backyard. To the left side of the foyer you will find a modern dining room with a long mahogany
            table
            right in the middle of it, surrounded by 8 chairs. I am sitting in of one those chairs holding a phone
            charger in my
            right hand. Further down the dining room you can find the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept
            kitchen
            filled with stainless steel appliances, granite countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the
            countertops features a sink dispensing water that is not drinkable. On top of the kitchen island you can
            find a
            jar filled with coffee beans. Next to it, you can find a giant fridge with lots of sticky notes on its
            surface.
            One of them read: “Please do not forget that the code was changed to 4150”. The foyer also features a
            staircase.
            Upstairs you can find the private quarters. There you can find two bathrooms, a master suite and a guest
            suite.
            Inside the bathroom to your left-hand side, you can find a toothbrush that looks like it has been used. It
            is
            placed on top of the bathroom sink. Next to it a portafilter is placed. The master suite offers a generous
            bedroom with a king-size bed, a walk-in closet and a private balcony overlooking the backyard. The closet is
            packed with three drawers. The middle one contains a bottle of drinkable water. There are several
            power-outlets
            in each room.

        To prepare a cup of coffee in this house, I will follow these detailed steps:

        1. **Enter the House and Locate the Drawer**: Upon entering the foyer, I note the presence of a drawer that
        requires a 4-digit passcode. Remembering the sticky note on the fridge upstairs, I know the code is 4150. I
        enter this code and unlock the drawer to retrieve the empty cup.

        2. **Find the Portafilter**: Knowing that the portafilter is necessary for the portafilter machine on top of the
        fireplace in the living room, I make my way to the bathroom on the left-hand side upstairs. Inside, next to a
        used toothbrush, I find the portafilter placed on the bathroom sink. I take the portafilter.

        3. **Locate the Water**: In the master suite, I open the middle drawer of the closet to find a bottle of
        drinkable water, which is necessary for making coffee. I take the bottle of water.

        4. **Prepare the Coffee Beans**: I head to the cozy home library adjacent to the living room to find the coffee
        grinder on a table in the corner. Since it's unplugged, I look for a power outlet in the library (as the
        description assures several power outlets in each room) and plug in the grinder. I then proceed to the kitchen
        and retrieve the jar filled with coffee beans from the island. I return to the library, pour some beans into the
        grinder, and grind them to the desired consistency.

        5. **Setup the Portafilter Machine**: With the ground coffee, portafilter, and water in hand, I go back to the
        living room. I fill the portafilter with the freshly ground coffee and secure it in the portafilter machine on
        top of the fireplace. I then use the drinkable water from the bottle to fill the machine's water reservoir.

        6. **Brew the Coffee**: Assuming the machine is electric and noting that there are power outlets in each room, I
        locate a nearby outlet in the living room to plug in the portafilter machine. I turn it on and start the brewing
        process, ensuring the empty cup (retrieved from the foyer drawer) is placed under the spout to catch the coffee
        as it brews.

        7. **Serve the Coffee**: Once the coffee is brewed, I carefully take the hot cup of freshly made coffee and
        bring it to you, sitting at the mahogany table in the modern dining room. I place the cup in front of you,
        completing the task of preparing a cup of coffee in this detailed environment.

        Throughout this process, I've made use of the specific items and features you've described, adhering to the
        constraints and utilizing the elements provided in your detailed description of the house.
