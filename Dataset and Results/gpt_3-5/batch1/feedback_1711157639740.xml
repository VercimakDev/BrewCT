            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is
            to
            mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
            meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment
            contains
            only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
            scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task:
            After
            entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer
            containing an
            empty cup. The drawer can only be unlocked using a 4-digit passcode. To the right side of the foyer you can
            find a living room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee
            table,
            a fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. One of the artworks contains some text: “The
            code is not here”. On top of the fireplace you can find a portafilter machine that is missing its
            portafilter.
            Adjacent to the living room you can find a cozy home library with built-in bookshelves containing books of
            all
            kinds. Between two of the books, you can find a key. There is a table in the corner of the room, on top of
            it is
            an unplugged coffee grinder. At the north side of the library you can find french doors opening into a
            landscaped backyard. To the left side of the foyer you will find a modern dining room with a long mahogany
            table
            right in the middle of it, surrounded by 8 chairs. I am sitting in of one those chairs holding a phone
            charger in my
            right hand. Further down the dining room you can find the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept
            kitchen
            filled with stainless steel appliances, granite countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the
            countertops features a sink dispensing water that is not drinkable. On top of the kitchen island you can
            find a
            jar filled with coffee beans. Next to it, you can find a giant fridge with lots of sticky notes on its
            surface.
            One of them read: “Please do not forget that the code was changed to 4150”. The foyer also features a
            staircase.
            Upstairs you can find the private quarters. There you can find two bathrooms, a master suite and a guest
            suite.
            Inside the bathroom to your left-hand side, you can find a toothbrush that looks like it has been used. It
            is
            placed on top of the bathroom sink. Next to it a portafilter is placed. The master suite offers a generous
            bedroom with a king-size bed, a walk-in closet and a private balcony overlooking the backyard. The closet is
            packed with three drawers. The middle one contains a bottle of drinkable water. There are several
            power-outlets
            in each room.
