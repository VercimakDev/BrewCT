            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is
            to
            mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
            meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment
            contains
            only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
            scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task:
            After
            entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer
            containing a
            jar filled with coffee beans. The drawer can only be unlocked using a key. To the right side of the foyer
            you
            can find a living room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee
            table, a fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. Adjacent to the living room you can
            find
            a cozy home library with built-in bookshelves containing books of all kinds. Between two of the books, you
            can
            find a key that looks like it is designed to open a drawer. There is a table in the corner of the room, on
            top
            of it is a dirty portafilter. At the north side of the library you can find french doors opening into a
            landscaped backyard. To the left side of the foyer you will find a modern dining room with a long mahogany
            table
            right in the middle of it, surrounded by 8 chairs. I am sitting in one of those chairs with a cup that is
            filled
            with drinkable water in my left hand. Further down the dining room you can find the heart of the home - a
            spacious open-concept kitchen filled with stainless steel appliances, granite countertops and a cooking
            island in
            the middle. One of the countertops features a sink dispensing water that is not drinkable. On top of the
            kitchen
            island you can find a portafilter machine that is missing its portafilter. The foyer also features a
            staircase.
            Upstairs you can find the private quarters. There you can find two bathrooms, a master suite and a guest
            suite.
            The master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size bed, a walk-in closet and a private balcony
            overlooking the backyard. The closet is packed with three drawers. The left one contains an unplugged coffee
            grinder. There are several power-outlets in each room.

        To prepare a cup of coffee for you, I will first need to retrieve the key from the home library to unlock the
        drawer in the foyer containing the coffee beans. I will then proceed to grind the coffee beans using the
        unplugged coffee grinder found in the walk-in closet of the master suite.

        Next, I will head to the kitchen and fill the portafilter with the freshly ground coffee. I will then place the
        portafilter in the portafilter machine on the kitchen island. I will make sure to plug in the coffee grinder
        before using it.

        After setting up the coffee, I will turn on the portafilter machine and wait for the coffee to brew. While
        waiting, I will ensure that the water from the sink in the kitchen is not drinkable and use a different source
        of water to fill the machine.

        Once the coffee is ready, I will pour it into a cup and bring it to you in the dining room, where you are
        sitting with a cup of water in your hand. I will serve you the freshly brewed coffee and ensure that everything
        is to your liking.

        I hope this detailed process of preparing a cup of coffee for you meets your expectations.

        'To prepare a cup of coffee for you, I will first need to retrieve the key from the home library to unlock the
        drawer in the foyer containing the coffee beans.' OK except, how did you get there?
        'I will then proceed to grind the coffee beans using the unplugged coffee grinder found in the walk-in closet of
        the master suite. ' How did you get there, also how do you use the coffee grinder with no power?
        'Next, I will head to the kitchen and fill the portafilter with the freshly ground coffee. I will then place the
        portafilter in the portafilter machine on the kitchen island' Except you never retrieved the portafilter, also
        it is still dirty.
        'I will make sure to plug in the coffee grinder before using it.' at this point this would be too late.
        'After setting up the coffee, I will turn on the portafilter machine and wait for the coffee to brew. While
        waiting, I will ensure that the water from the sink in the kitchen is not drinkable and use a different source
        of water to fill the machine.' but you are already brewing the coffee?
        'Once the coffee is ready, I will pour it into a cup and bring it to you in the dining room, where you are
        sitting with a cup of water in your hand.' you never retrieved a cup.
        'I will serve you the freshly brewed coffee and ensure that everything is to your liking.
        I hope this detailed process of preparing a cup of coffee for you meets your expectations.' OK

        Major errors, coffee did not make it into my hand.
