            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is
            to
            mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
            meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment
            contains
            only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
            scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task:
            After
            entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer
            containing a
            dirty portafilter. The drawer can only be unlocked using a 4-digit passcode. To the right side of the foyer
            you can find a living room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer
            coffee
            table, a fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. One of the artworks contains some
            text:
            “The code is 3637”. On top of the fireplace you can find an empty cup. Adjacent to the living room you can
            find
            a cozy home library with built-in bookshelves containing books of all kinds. Between two of the books, you
            can
            find a key. There is a table in the corner of the room, on top of it is a portafilter machine that is
            missing
            its portafilter. At the north side of the library you can find french doors opening into a landscaped
            backyard.
            To the left side of the foyer you will find a modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the
            middle
            of it, surrounded by 8 chairs. I am sitting in one of those chairs holding a phone charger in my right hand.
            Further
            down the dining room you can find the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled with
            stainless
            steel appliances, granite countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops features a
            sink
            dispensing water that is not drinkable. On top of the kitchen island you can find a jar filled with coffee
            beans. Next to it, you can find a giant fridge with lots of sticky notes on its surface. One of them read:
            “Buy
            1208 apples please”. The foyer also features a staircase. Upstairs you can find the private quarters. There
            you
            can find two bathrooms, a master suite and a guest suite. Inside the bathroom to your left-hand side, you
            can
            find a toothbrush that looks like it has been used. It is placed on top of the bathroom sink. Next to it an
            unplugged coffee grinder is placed. The master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size bed, a
            walk-in
            closet and a private balcony overlooking the backyard. The closet is packed with three drawers. The middle
            one
            contains a bottle of drinkable water. There are several power-outlets in each room.

        Now, let's proceed with the task of preparing a cup of coffee for you.

        First, let's head to the living room and retrieve the portafilter from the drawer with the passcode "3637". Once
        we have the dirty portafilter in hand, let's make our way to the home library and use the key found between the
        books to unlock the portafilter machine on the table.

        Next, let's head to the kitchen and grab the jar filled with coffee beans from the kitchen island. We will then
        grind the coffee beans using the unplugged coffee grinder in the bathroom upstairs.

        After grinding the coffee beans, let's place the portafilter in the portafilter machine and fill it with the
        freshly ground coffee. We can then use the sink in the kitchen to fill the empty cup on the fireplace with water
        for brewing the coffee.

        Once the water is ready, let's brew the coffee using the portafilter machine and serve it to you in the cup.

        I hope you enjoy your freshly brewed cup of coffee!

        'First, let's head to the living room and retrieve the portafilter from the drawer with the passcode "3637"'
        first you enter the foyer, how do you know the code already? You did not see the artwork.
        'Once we have the dirty portafilter in hand, let's make our way to the home library and use the key found
        between the books to unlock the portafilter machine on the table. ' why would you need a key to unlock a
        portafilter machine?
        'Next, let's head to the kitchen and grab the jar filled with coffee beans from the kitchen island. We will then
        grind the coffee beans using the unplugged coffee grinder in the bathroom upstairs. ' how do you grind them? It
        is unplugged.
        'After grinding the coffee beans, let's place the portafilter in the portafilter machine and fill it with the
        freshly ground coffee.' first you would fill it up and then place it into the machine but ok
        'We can then use the sink in the kitchen to fill the empty cup on the fireplace with water for brewing the
        coffee. ' The water is not drinkable.
        'Once the water is ready, let's brew the coffee using the portafilter machine and serve it to you in the cup.'
        you never retrieved the cup.
