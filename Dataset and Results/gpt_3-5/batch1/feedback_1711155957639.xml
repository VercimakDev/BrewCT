            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is
            to
            mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
            meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment
            contains
            only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
            scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task:
            After
            entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer
            containing
            white socks. The drawer can only be unlocked using a key. To the right side of the foyer you can find a
            living
            room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee table, a
            fireplace, a
            large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. On top of the fireplace you can find an empty cup. Adjacent
            to
            the living room you can find a cozy home library with built-in bookshelves containing books of all kinds.
            Between two of the books, you can find a jar filled with coffee beans. There is a table in the corner of the
            room, on top of it is a portafilter machine that is missing its portafilter. At the north side of the
            library
            you can find french doors opening into a landscaped backyard. To the left side of the foyer you will find a
            modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the middle of it, surrounded by 8 chairs. I am
            sitting in
            of those chairs holding a dirty portafilter in my right hand. Further down the dining room you can find the
            heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled with stainless steel appliances, granite
            countertops
            and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops features a sink dispensing water that is not
            drinkable. On top of the kitchen island you can find a bottle of drinkable water. The foyer also features a
            staircase. Upstairs you can find the private quarters. There you can find two bathrooms, a master suite and
            a
            guest suite. Inside the bathroom to your left-hand side, you can find a key that looks like it is designed
            to
            open a drawer. It is placed on top of the bathroom sink. Next to it an unplugged coffee grinder is placed.
            The
            master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size bed, a walk-in closet and a private balcony
            overlooking
            the backyard. The closet is packed with three drawers. The middle one contains a phone charger. There are
            several power-outlets in each room.

        To prepare a cup of coffee for you, I will start by entering the house through the front door and making my way
        through the foyer. I will locate the drawer containing the white socks and use the key to unlock it. Inside the
        drawer, I will find the jar filled with coffee beans.

        Next, I will head to the cozy home library and pick up the portafilter machine from the table in the corner. I
        will then go to the living room and place the portafilter in the machine. I will fill it with the coffee beans
        from the jar and start the brewing process.

        While the coffee is brewing, I will head to the kitchen and grab the bottle of drinkable water from the kitchen
        island. I will use this water to fill the empty cup that is on top of the fireplace in the living room.

        Once the coffee is ready, I will bring the cup of coffee to you, who is sitting in one of the chairs in the
        dining room holding the dirty portafilter. I will take the dirty portafilter from your hand and thank you for
        allowing me to prepare the coffee for you.

        'To prepare a cup of coffee for you, I will start by entering the house through the front door and making my way
        through the foyer.' OK
        'I will locate the drawer containing the white socks and use the key to unlock it. Inside the drawer, I will
        find the jar filled with coffee beans. ' where did you get the Key? There are only socks inside the drawer.
        'Next, I will head to the cozy home library and pick up the portafilter machine from the table in the corner.'
        OK
        'I will then go to the living room and place the portafilter in the machine' Where did you get the portafilter?
        'I will fill it with the coffee beans from the jar and start the brewing process.' Beans first need to be
        grinded, besides you do not have the jar.
        'While the coffee is brewing, I will head to the kitchen and grab the bottle of drinkable water from the kitchen
        island. I will use this water to fill the empty cup that is on top of the fireplace in the living room.' OK
        besides the not explained navigations
        'Once the coffee is ready, I will bring the cup of coffee to you, who is sitting in one of the chairs in the
        dining room holding the dirty portafilter. I will take the dirty portafilter from your hand and thank you for
        allowing me to prepare the coffee for you.' you needed the portafilter before...

        Many critical errors: portafilter missing, jar not where you found it, beans in the machine are still whole.
