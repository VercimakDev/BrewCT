            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is
            to
            mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
            meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment
            contains
            only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
            scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task:
            After
            entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer
            containing a
            jar filled with coffee beans. The drawer can only be unlocked using a 4-digit passcode. To the right side of
            the foyer you can find a living room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a
            designer coffee table, a fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. On top of the
            fireplace
            you can find an empty cup. Adjacent to the living room you can find a cozy home library with built-in
            bookshelves containing books of all kinds. Between two of the books, you can find a key. There is a table in
            the
            corner of the room, on top of it is a portafilter machine that is missing its portafilter. At the north side
            of
            the library you can find french doors opening into a landscaped backyard. To the left side of the foyer you
            will
            find a modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the middle of it, surrounded by 8 chairs. I am
            sitting in one of those chairs holding a phone charger in my right hand. Further down the dining room you
            can find
            the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled with stainless steel appliances, granite
            countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops features a sink dispensing water that
            is
            not drinkable. On top of the kitchen island you can find a bottle of drinkable water. Next to it, you can
            find a
            giant fridge with lots of sticky notes on its surface. One of them read: “The code is 3067”. The foyer also
            features a staircase. Upstairs you can find the private quarters. There you can find two bathrooms, a master
            suite and a guest suite. Inside the bathroom to your left-hand side, you can find a toothbrush that looks
            like
            it has been used. It is placed on top of the bathroom sink. Next to it an unplugged coffee grinder is
            placed.
            The master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size bed, a walk-in closet and a private balcony
            overlooking the backyard. The closet is packed with three drawers. The middle one contains a dirty
            portafilter.
            There are several power-outlets in each room.

        To prepare a cup of coffee for you, I will start by entering the house through the front door and making my way
        to the foyer. Once there, I will locate the drawer containing the jar filled with coffee beans. To unlock the
        drawer, I will input the 4-digit passcode, which is 3067, as indicated on the sticky note on the fridge in the
        kitchen.

        After retrieving the coffee beans, I will head to the living room where I will find the empty cup on top of the
        fireplace. I will then make my way to the cozy home library and pick up the key hidden between two books. Using
        this key, I will unlock the portafilter machine on the table in the corner of the room.

        Next, I will head to the kitchen and grab the bottle of drinkable water from the kitchen island. I will fill the
        portafilter with coffee beans and place it in the portafilter machine. I will then use the sink to fill the cup
        with water and place it under the portafilter to brew the coffee.

        While the coffee is brewing, I will make my way upstairs to the master suite where I will find the toothbrush on
        the bathroom sink and the unplugged coffee grinder. I will plug in the coffee grinder and grind some fresh
        coffee beans to enhance the flavor of the brew.

        Once the coffee is ready, I will pour it into the cup and bring it to you, sitting in the dining room surrounded
        by the mahogany table and chairs. I will hand you the cup of freshly brewed coffee, prepared with meticulous
        attention to detail just as you requested.

        'To prepare a cup of coffee for you, I will start by entering the house through the front door and making my way
        to the foyer. Once there, I will locate the drawer containing the jar filled with coffee beans.' OK
        'To unlock the drawer, I will input the 4-digit passcode, which is 3067, as indicated on the sticky note on the
        fridge in the kitchen.' How do you know, you were not there yet?
        'After retrieving the coffee beans, I will head to the living room where I will find the empty cup on top of the
        fireplace' OK
        'I will then make my way to the cozy home library and pick up the key hidden between two books. Using this key,
        I will unlock the portafilter machine on the table in the corner of the room.' OK but there is nothing to
        unlock?
        'Next, I will head to the kitchen and grab the bottle of drinkable water from the kitchen island. I will fill
        the portafilter with coffee beans and place it in the portafilter machine. I will then use the sink to fill the
        cup with water and place it under the portafilter to brew the coffee.' Do you use the not drinkable water? Or
        only using the sink to not spill the water from the bottle? Why do you fill up the cup with water, the water
        should go into the watertank of the machine
        'While the coffee is brewing, I will make my way upstairs to the master suite where I will find the toothbrush
        on the bathroom sink and the unplugged coffee grinder. I will plug in the coffee grinder and grind some fresh
        coffee beans to enhance the flavor of the brew.' This is too late, you are already brewing the coffee.
        'Once the coffee is ready, I will pour it into the cup and bring it to you, sitting in the dining room
        surrounded by the mahogany table and chairs. I will hand you the cup of freshly brewed coffee, prepared with
        meticulous attention to detail just as you requested.' OK

        Critical errors: beans not grinded, used non drinkable water
