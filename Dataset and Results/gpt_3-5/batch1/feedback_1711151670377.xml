            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is to
        mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
        meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment contains
        only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
        scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task: After
        entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer containing a
        portafilter there. To the right side of the foyer you can find a living room that is filled with natural light.
        There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee table, a fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on
        the walls. Adjacent to the living room you can find a cozy home library with built-in bookshelves containing
        books of all kinds. There is a table in the corner of the room, on top of it is a jar filled with coffee beans.
        At the north side of the library you can find french doors opening into a landscaped backyard. To the left side
        of the foyer you will find a modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the middle of it, surrounded
        by 8 chairs. I am sitting in one of those chairs with an empty cup in my right hand. Further down the dining room
        you can find the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled with stainless steel appliances,
        granite countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops features a sink dispensing
        drinkable water. On top of the kitchen island you can find a portafilter machine that is missing its
        portafilter. The foyer also features a staircase. Upstairs you can find the private quarters. There you can find
        two bathrooms, a master suite and a guest suite. The master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size
        bed, a walk-in closet and a private balcony overlooking the backyard. The closet is packed with three drawers.
        The left one contains an unplugged coffee grinder. There are several power-outlets in each room.

        To prepare a cup of coffee for you, I will first head to the foyer and open the drawer where the
    portafilter is located. I will then grab the portafilter and head to the kitchen. I will place the portafilter in
    the portafilter machine on the kitchen island.

    Next, I will head to the corner of the home library where the jar filled with coffee beans is placed. I will scoop
    out the desired amount of coffee beans and grind them using the unplugged coffee grinder from the master suite
    closet.

    After grinding the coffee beans, I will place them into the portafilter in the machine. I will then turn on the
    machine and let it brew the coffee. While the coffee is brewing, I will head to the dining room where you are
    sitting with an empty cup in your hand.

    I will pour the freshly brewed coffee into your cup and serve it to you. I will ensure that the coffee is prepared
    to your liking and that you are satisfied with the drink. I will also clean up any mess and put away any unused
    items before leaving the house.

    I hope you enjoy your coffee!

        'To prepare a cup of coffee for you, I will first head to the foyer and open the drawer where the portafilter
    is located.' OK
    'I will then grab the portafilter and head to the kitchen.' How do you get there? You first have to go left in the
    foyer and cross the dining room.
    ' I will place the portafilter in the portafilter machine on the kitchen island.' OK, but portarfilter is empty?
    'Next, I will head to the corner of the home library where the jar filled with coffee beans is placed.' again no
    description how you went there.
    'I will scoop out the desired amount of coffee beans and grind them using the unplugged coffee grinder from the
    master suite closet.' How did you get to the master suite? How do you use the grinder without any power?
    'After grinding the coffee beans, I will place them into the portafilter in the machine.' you would have to first
    take out the portafilter
    'I will then turn on the machine and let it brew the coffee' Where does the coffee go if there is no cup under the
    portafilter?
    'While the coffee is brewing, I will head to the dining room where you are sitting with an empty cup in your hand.'
    too late the coffee already spilled.
    'I will pour the freshly brewed coffee into your cup and serve it to you.' where do you pour if from?
    'I will ensure that the coffee is prepared to your liking and that you are satisfied with the drink. I will also
    clean up any mess and put away any unused items before leaving the house. I hope you enjoy your coffee!' cleaning
    was not part of it so no need to explain, therefore OK

    Some critical errors made, coffee would not make it to me.
