            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is
            to
            mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
            meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment
            contains
            only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
            scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task:
            After
            entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. In the foyer you can find a drawer
            containing
            toothpaste. The drawer can only be unlocked using a 4-digit passcode. To the right side of the foyer you can
            find a living room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee
            table,
            a fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. One of the artworks contains some text: “The
            code is not here”. On top of the fireplace you can find a jar filled with coffee beans. Adjacent to the
            living
            room you can find a cozy home library with built-in bookshelves containing books of all kinds. Between two
            of
            the books, you can find a key. There is a table in the corner of the room, on top of it is an unplugged
            coffee
            grinder. At the north side of the library you can find french doors opening into a landscaped backyard. In
            the
            backyard you can find an outdoor table, on top of it a dirty cup is placed. To the left side of the foyer
            you
            will find a modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the middle of it, surrounded by 8 chairs.
            I
            am sitting in one of those chairs holding a bottle of drinkable water in my right hand. Further down the
            dining room
            you can find the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled with stainless steel appliances,
            granite countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops features a sink dispensing
            water
            that is not drinkable. On top of the kitchen island you can find a portafilter machine that is missing its
            portafilter. Next to it, you can find a giant fridge with lots of sticky notes on its surface. One of them
            read:
            “Please do not forget that the code was changed to 4150”. The foyer also features a staircase. Upstairs you
            can
            find the private quarters. There you can find two bathrooms, a master suite and a guest suite. Inside the
            bathroom to your left-hand side, you can find a toothbrush that looks like it has been used. It is placed on
            top
            of the bathroom sink. The master suite offers a generous bedroom with a king-size bed, a walk-in closet and
            a
            private balcony overlooking the backyard. The closet is packed with three drawers. The middle one contains a
            portafilter. There are several power-outlets in each room.
