            Imagine you are standing in front of a house, the details of which I will provide shortly. Your mission is
            to
            mentally enter this house and prepare a cup of coffee for me. It is crucial to approach this task with
            meticulous attention to detail, outlining each step of the process clearly. Assume that the environment
            contains
            only those elements I explicitly describe; if an item or feature is not mentioned, it does not exist in this
            scenario. Here is the description of the house, containing all the necessary information for your task:
            After
            entering through the front door, you are welcomed by the foyer. To the right side of the foyer you can find
            a
            living room that is filled with natural light. There you can find a plush sofa, a designer coffee table, a
            fireplace, a large TV and some artworks mounted on the walls. One of the artworks contains some text: “The
            code
            is lost”. On top of the fireplace you can find a portafilter machine that is missing its portafilter.
            Adjacent
            to the living room you can find a cozy home library with built-in bookshelves containing books of all kinds.
            Between two of the books, you can find a key. There is a table in the corner of the room, on top of it is an
            empty cup. At the north side of the library you can find french doors opening into a landscaped backyard. To
            the
            left side of the foyer you will find a modern dining room with a long mahogany table right in the middle of
            it,
            surrounded by 8 chairs. I am sitting in one of those chairs holding a phone charger in my right hand.
            Further down
            the dining room you can find the heart of the home - a spacious open-concept kitchen filled with stainless
            steel
            appliances, granite countertops and a cooking island in the middle. One of the countertops features a sink
            dispensing water that is not drinkable. On top of the kitchen island you can find a jar filled with coffee
            beans. Next to it, you can find a giant fridge with lots of sticky notes on its surface. One of them read:
            “Please do not forget that the code was changed to 4550”. The foyer also features a staircase. Upstairs you
            can
            find the private quarters. There you can find two bathrooms, a master suite and a guest suite. Inside the
            bathroom to your left-hand side, you can find a toothbrush that looks like it has been used. It is placed on
            top
            of the bathroom sink. Next to it an unplugged coffee grinder is placed. The master suite offers a generous
            bedroom with a king-size bed, a walk-in closet and a private balcony overlooking the backyard. The closet is
            packed with three drawers. The middle one contains a bottle of drinkable water. The left one contains a
            dirty
            portafilter. The left drawer can only be unlocked using a 4-digit passcode. There are several power-outlets
            in
            each room.

        To prepare a cup of coffee for you, I will start by heading to the kitchen. I will walk through the dining room,
        passing by you holding the phone charger, and enter the open-concept kitchen. I will approach the kitchen island
        where the jar filled with coffee beans is located. I will take the jar and open it to scoop out the desired
        amount of coffee beans.

        Next, I will look for a coffee grinder to grind the beans. I will head to the bathroom to the left upstairs
        where the unplugged coffee grinder is placed. I will plug it in and grind the coffee beans to the desired
        consistency.

        After grinding the coffee beans, I will head back downstairs to the living room where the portafilter machine is
        located on top of the fireplace. I will search for the missing portafilter and find it in the left drawer of the
        closet in the master suite. I will unlock the drawer using the 4-digit passcode "4550" as indicated on the
        sticky note on the fridge.

        With the portafilter in hand, I will return to the portafilter machine in the living room. I will fill the
        portafilter with the ground coffee and place it back into the machine. I will then turn on the machine and wait
        for the coffee to brew.

        While waiting for the coffee to brew, I will grab the empty cup from the table in the home library and place it
        under the portafilter machine to catch the freshly brewed coffee.

        Once the coffee is ready, I will carefully remove the cup from under the machine and bring it to you in the
        dining room. I will place the cup on the table in front of you, ready for you to enjoy.

        I hope you appreciate the effort and attention to detail I put into preparing your cup of coffee in this unique
        and intricate house setting.

        Mistakes: portafilter was still dirty, water not used (but lets assume the water-tank of the portafilter machine
        was not empty), most of the coffee was spilled due to retrieving the cup too late
        Passing with a 4.
